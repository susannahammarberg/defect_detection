# Defect detection computer vision 
A simple vision system for defect detection of casting product images.

The images are put into two categories, ok or defect.

What do you want the model to predict? 
Either that there is a defect or not?
Or do you want to classify the defect?
What should the output be, should it be just yes or no to defect?
